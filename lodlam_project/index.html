                This <strong>ontology-based</strong> project was developed for the Information Science and Cultural Heritage course at the University of Bologna, taught by Professor Francesca Tomasi and Professor Marilena Daquino.
              </p>
              <p>
                It focuses on the Byzantine Emperor <strong>Justinian I</strong>, collecting, analyzing, and semantically interlinking a curated set of <strong>cultural heritage items</strong> —including mosaics, buildings, historical documents, artifacts, audiovisual resources, and digital media—related to his reign and legacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through <strong>Linked Open Data</strong> methodologies, the project constructs a dynamic knowledge graph, in which entities, drawn from diverse sources, are interconnected across disciplines and institutions. This not only enriches academic research but also ensures that Justinian’s multifaceted heritage — from the <em>Corpus Iuris Civilis</em> to the Hagia Sophia, from artistic representations to modern cultural reinterpretations — is preserved, accessible, and constantly recontextualized.
              </p>
              <p>
                LOD are the foundation of the <strong>Semantic Web</strong>, an evolution of the traditional web that aims to make data understandable to machines as well. The goal is to transform the web into a network of semantically interconnected data.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve this, the metadata provided by the institutions holding the selected items were transformed into <strong>semantic triples</strong> composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. This is a key step in our project, and it is where <strong>RDF</strong> becomes essential. RDF is one of the fundamental technologies of the Semantic Web, used to structure and link data on the web. In addition to RDF, other technologies such as <strong>TEI/XML</strong> were used in the text analysis section.

                The project's conceptualization began with a collective discussion driven by our shared interest in the <strong>Arthurian cycle</strong>. From this initial exploration, the myth of <strong>The Sword in the Stone</strong> emerged as a particularly compelling subject. This theme not only provided a strong foundation for our collaborative work but also offered a rich narrative framework for a detailed analysis of its characters, symbols, and concepts. Our unanimous enthusiasm for this topic became a driving force, motivating us throughout the project's development.
              </p>
              <p>
                The legend is one of the foundational myths of Western tradition, rich in symbolic and narrative elements that have endured through the centuries. Its origins lie in Celtic traditions and the oral tales of ancient Britain, gradually evolving into a true saga thanks to medieval reinterpretations, particularly starting with Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (12th century). This gave rise to the tradition of the Breton cycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the heart of the legend stands <strong>King Arthur</strong>, a just and noble ruler, chosen according to tradition by drawing the mythical sword Excalibur from the stone—a symbol of divine legitimacy and power. At his side appears the wise and mysterious <strong>Merlin</strong>, enchanter and advisor, embodying arcane knowledge and magical forces that guide and protect the destiny of the king and his realm: the mythical Camelot.
              </p>
              <p>
                The popularity of the legend did not fade in the Middle Ages. The Arthurian cycle enjoyed vast literary and artistic success, eventually leading to modern adaptations in fantasy novels, graphic novels, films, and television series. In cinema and TV, works such as Excalibur (1981), King Arthur (2004), and the BBC series Merlin have breathed new life into these characters, demonstrating the enduring relevance of the myth.

              <p>To ground our project in tangible cultural heritage, we conducted targeted research to identify relevant key cultural artifacts.

          <h3>Metadata Analysis</h3>
          
          <div class="idea-text">
            <p>
              The first activity carried out by the team was the identification of the <strong>metadata standard</strong> adopted by the providers of the selected items, with the goal of ensuring <strong>interoperability</strong>. In cases where the institution had not explicitly stated the standard in use, the team decided to apply either the standard commonly adopted by similar institutions or the one deemed most suitable and relevant to the nature of the object, according to semantic accuracy and the context of usage of the formal grammar chosen. In such cases, the symbol * was used.
            </p>
            <p>
              While an institution like, for example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art provides an API for its metadata but does not explicitly declare the use of a pre-existing metadata standard, in our project we made the conscious decision to adopt <strong>CDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art)</strong>, the typical content standard for the museum context. This choice was motivated by the fact that the metadata provided by The Met appeared to faithfully reflect the categories defined by the CDWA standard—with fields such as Title, Style, Measurements, Materials, Current Location... This led us to deduce that, in the absence of an explicit declaration, The Met was likely inspired by this standard to structure its information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team also highlighted the distinction between a general classification of the items and a more specific and detailed description, allowing for a more precise definition of the type of object actually held by the institution or of its concrete artistic manifestation. For example: is it a printed or a electronic edition (es.eBook)? Is the soundtrack in CD or vinyl format? Can the item be broadly classified as a work of art, and more specifically as a statue, a painting, or a tapestry…?
