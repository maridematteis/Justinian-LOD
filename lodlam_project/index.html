                This <strong>ontology-based</strong> project was developed for the Information Science and Cultural Heritage course at the University of Bologna, taught by Professor Francesca Tomasi and Professor Marilena Daquino.
              </p>
              <p>
                It focuses on the Byzantine Emperor <strong>Justinian I</strong>, collecting, analyzing, and semantically interlinking a curated set of <strong>cultural heritage items</strong> —including mosaics, buildings, historical documents, artifacts, audiovisual resources, and digital media—related to his reign and legacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through <strong>Linked Open Data</strong> methodologies, the project constructs a dynamic knowledge graph, in which entities, drawn from diverse sources, are interconnected across disciplines and institutions. This not only enriches academic research but also ensures that Justinian’s multifaceted heritage — from the <em>Corpus Iuris Civilis</em> to the Hagia Sophia, from artistic representations to modern cultural reinterpretations — is preserved, accessible, and constantly recontextualized.
              </p>
              <p>
                LOD are the foundation of the <strong>Semantic Web</strong>, an evolution of the traditional web that aims to make data understandable to machines as well. The goal is to transform the web into a network of semantically interconnected data.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve this, the metadata provided by the institutions holding the selected items were transformed into <strong>semantic triples</strong> composed of a subject, a predicate, and an object. This is a key step in our project, and it is where <strong>RDF</strong> becomes essential. RDF is one of the fundamental technologies of the Semantic Web, used to structure and link data on the web. In addition to RDF, other technologies such as <strong>TEI/XML</strong> were used in the text analysis section.

              <p>The project stems from a collective reflection on the role of figures and monuments that serve as a junction between different cultural traditions.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Justinian I</strong> was chosen because, more than many other late antique rulers, he embodies the tension and <strong>encounter between East and West</strong>: from the legal reforms of the <italic>Corpus Iuris Civilis</italic> to grandiose architectural undertakings such as the Hagia Sophia, his political and symbolic action produced material and textual traces that cross borders and languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                The popularity and resonance of Justinian’s image did not end with his lifetime. From Dante’s celebrated invocation in <em>Paradiso</em> to modern historiography, cinema, music and games, Justinian’s figure has been continuously reinterpreted. Contemporary media continue to reframe his achievements and controversies, showing how a sixth-century emperor still informs debates about law, empire, faith, and the interchange between East and West.

              We conducted targeted research to identify <strong>ten key items</strong> directly connected to Justinian’s reign and later reception. The selection spans media and periods: mosaics and architecture, numismatics, manuscripts and legal codices, visual art, film and music, and contemporary games.

          <h3>Metadata Analysis</h3>
          
          <div class="idea-text">
            <p>
              The first activity carried out by the team was the identification of the <strong>metadata standard</strong> adopted by the providers of the selected items, with the goal of ensuring <strong>interoperability</strong>. In cases where the institution had not explicitly stated the standard in use, the team decided to apply either the standard commonly adopted by similar institutions or the one deemed most suitable and relevant to the nature of the object, according to semantic accuracy and the context of usage of the formal grammar chosen. In such cases, the symbol * was used.
            </p>
            <p>
              While an institution like, for example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art provides an API for its metadata but does not explicitly declare the use of a pre-existing metadata standard, in our project we made the conscious decision to adopt <strong>CDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art)</strong>, the typical content standard for the museum context. This choice was motivated by the fact that the metadata provided by The Met appeared to faithfully reflect the categories defined by the CDWA standard—with fields such as Title, Style, Measurements, Materials, Current Location... This led us to deduce that, in the absence of an explicit declaration, The Met was likely inspired by this standard to structure its information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team also highlighted the distinction between a general classification of the items and a more specific and detailed description, allowing for a more precise definition of the type of object actually held by the institution or of its concrete artistic manifestation. For example: is it a printed or a electronic edition (es.eBook)? Is the soundtrack in CD or vinyl format? Can the item be broadly classified as a work of art, and more specifically as a statue, a painting, or a tapestry…?

                    <p>
                      Our coding work focused on selected excerpts from Procopius's <cite>History of the Wars</cite>. 
                      Specifically, we coded the <strong>Introduction</strong> and <strong>Chapters XIII-XIV</strong> of <strong>Book I</strong> in Loeb's English translation as represented in the <cite>Internet Archive</cite> copy.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                      The excerpts were chosen because they explicitly situate the initial phase of Justinian's reign in the Persian (Mesopotamian) theater of operations and introduce key actors and events used in our LOD case study. 
                      Chapter XIII, in particular, introduces Justinian in the context of the war against the Persians and describes the appointment of Belisarius and the preparations for the battle. 
                      Chapter XIV continues the narrative of the campaign and contains further descriptions of troop deployments, commanders, and locations.

                                text type (essay) and so on. 
                            <p>
                                It also includes structured metadata such as a list of organizations, three separate lists of people (authors and editors, historical figures, and legendary characters cited), and a list of places (historical and mythical). 
                                In the text, the names of <strong>people or places</strong> are marked with @ref, which points to the xml:id in the lists of the teiHeader, and from there they can also be linked to external identifiers, just as it was done. Viaf, Geonames, Pleiades and Wikidata have been used.

                                Furthermore, keywords considered meaningful for the project—such as celtic traditions and sword—are also included (both in Italian and English) to highlight central ideas of the Sword in the Stone legend.
